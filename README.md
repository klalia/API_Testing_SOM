# API_Testing_SOM

This is my service object model (SOM) boiler plate. This file consisted of the layout to create a SOM using the tests and methods used to test the postcode API (http://postcodes.io/). A SOM is used to make code more reusable and maintainable. It ensures that there is not a lot of repeatable code, no complex logic and not a lot to get to the end goal. It also consists of inheritance with the use of super classes and subclasses.

# API_Testing_SOM

This is my service object model (SOM) boiler plate. This file consisted of the layout to create a SOM using the tests and methods used to test the postcode API (http://postcodes.io/). A SOM is breaking API services down into objects to then create methods around the service and it's data. This abstracts logic from our tests making changes easier when a service or its data changes. A SOM makes code more reusable and maintainable. It also ensures that there is not a lot of repeatable code, no complex logic and not a lot to get to the end goal.
